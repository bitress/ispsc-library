                The purposed of this study is to design a centralize network plan of Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College, Tagudin Campus.
	This study aimed to: design a network infrastructure plan for Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College, Tagudin Campus through equipment and connections; and to test the reliability of the plan.
	As basis on the design of the network infrastructure plan, the necessary requirements were gathered regarding the current blueprint of the Tagudin Campus. Some of the offices has its own internet connection where there is no control in the use of internet and some offices used wired connection. They do not used file sharing because the computers their using are not connected at all. The researchers reviewed and analyzed all the requirements.
	The researches designed a physical and network layout. After finalizing the design, the researchers setup a wireless network plan with the use of network equipment such as access point, routers and switch. The office of the Executive Campus Administrator was set with the equipment mentioned.
	The researchers used ping to determine the reliability of the developed plan for the ISPSC, Tagudin Campus.

Specifically, the following sub-problems were answered: The profile of the AB-Senior Student of Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College, Tagudin Campus in terms of sex, occupation of parents, monthly income of the family, and type of school graduated from; the level of reading comprehension of the AB Senior Students of Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College, Tagudin Campus along literal, reorganization, inferential, evaluation, appreciation and reading comprehension skills of the AB Senior students related to their sex, occupation of parents, monthly income of the family, and type of school graduated from.
